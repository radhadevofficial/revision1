### Sample Interview Questions with Suggested Answers

**Q1: What is RAID and why is it used?**

**A:**
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology to combine multiple disks into one logical unit to improve performance, increase storage capacity, or provide redundancy in case of disk failure.

**Q2: What is the difference between Hardware and Software RAID?**

**A:**
* **Hardware RAID**: Managed by RAID controller card or motherboard BIOS.
* **Software RAID**: Managed by the operating system using tools like `mdadm` in Linux.
* Hardware RAID has better performance and is OS-independent.

**Q3: Explain RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10.**

**A:**
* **RAID 0**: No redundancy, just performance. If one disk fails, data is lost.
* **RAID 1**: Mirror. Same data written to 2 disks. High reliability.
* **RAID 5**: Striping + Parity. Need at least 3 disks. Can tolerate 1 disk failure.
* **RAID 10**: Combination of RAID 1 and 0. Needs 4 disks. High performance + redundancy.

üß† Tip: Draw a quick diagram if allowed in whiteboard rounds!

**Q4: Have you configured RAID manually? How?**

**A:**
If not done practically:

> I've studied and observed RAID setup during my RHCE/college project. For example, using `mdadm` in Linux:

```bash
mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
```

Then format and mount:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid
```

**Q5: What happens when one disk in RAID 5 fails?**

**A:**
* RAID 5 can continue to function with **1 disk failure** using parity data.
* However, performance decreases.
* If a second disk fails before rebuild, data is lost.

**Q6: How do you monitor disk health in Linux?**

**A:**
* `smartctl -a /dev/sdX` ‚Äì SMART disk health
* `dmesg` ‚Äì check kernel disk errors
* `cat /proc/mdstat` ‚Äì if using software RAID
* `lsblk`, `df -h` ‚Äì for mounted partitions
* Third-party tools: Zabbix, Nagios

### Commands to Remember

```bash
# View all disks and partitions
lsblk

# Disk space usage
df -h
du -sh /folder

# Create partition
fdisk /dev/sdb

# Check RAID status (software)
cat /proc/mdstat

# View SMART status
smartctl -a /dev/sda
```

| **GPO (Group Policy)**    | Automating settings and enforcing security |

### Sample Interview Questions & Good Answers

**Q1: What is Active Directory and what is it used for?**

**A:**
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft. It stores information about users, computers, and other resources in a domain and helps administrators manage access and security centrally.

* AD is used for **authentication (login)** and **authorization (permissions)**.
* AD stores data in a structured hierarchy (domain ‚Üí OU ‚Üí objects).

**Q2: What are the main components of Active Directory?**

**A:**
* **Domain**: Logical group of objects (users, computers).
* **OU (Organizational Unit)**: Subdivision of a domain used to organize objects.
* **Domain Controller (DC)**: Server that hosts AD services.
* **Forest & Tree**: Top-level logical structure that can contain multiple domains.

**Q3: What is DNS and why is it important for Active Directory?**

**A:**
* DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (e.g., `server01.domain.com`) to IP addresses.
* **AD requires DNS** to locate domain controllers and for login, replication, and services to work.

üß† AD creates special DNS records (SRV) during domain setup.

**Q4: What is DHCP and how does it work?**

**A:**
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices.

* The server maintains a **DHCP scope** (IP pool).
* Clients send a **DHCP Discover**, server replies with **Offer ‚Üí Request ‚Üí Acknowledge** (DORA process).

**Q5: What is Group Policy and how is it used?**

**A:**
Group Policy is a feature that allows administrators to define settings and rules for users or computers.

* GPOs (Group Policy Objects) are applied to **OUs** to enforce:
  * Security settings (password policy, screen lock)
  * Software deployment
  * Network configurations (drive mapping, firewall)

üß† Tools:
* `gpedit.msc` ‚Äì Local Group Policy Editor
* `gpmc.msc` ‚Äì Group Policy Management Console

**Q6: How do you create and apply a GPO?**

**A:**
1. Open **Group Policy Management Console** (`gpmc.msc`)
2. Right-click OU ‚Üí "Create a GPO"
3. Edit the GPO to configure settings
4. It automatically applies to all objects in the OU

**Q7: How do you troubleshoot GPO issues?**

**A:**
* Run `gpresult /h gp.html` or `gpresult /R` to check applied policies
* Use `rsop.msc` to simulate Resultant Set of Policy
* Use Event Viewer under **System or GroupPolicy** logs

**Q8: What is the difference between OU and Group?**

**A:**
* **OU** is used to organize objects (like a folder) ‚Äì GPOs apply here.
* **Group** is used to grant permissions to users (e.g., read-only access to a folder).

**Q9: What are the types of groups in Active Directory?**

**A:**
* **Security Group**: Used to assign permissions
* **Distribution Group**: Used for email (not for security)
* Scope:
  * **Global**: Members from same domain
  * **Domain Local**: Permissions in local domain
  * **Universal**: Members and permissions across domains

* Allocate CPU/RAM
* Configure storage/network
* Take snapshots before major changes

**Q3: What are snapshots in VMware and when should you use them?**

**A:**
Snapshots are point-in-time states of a VM, used for **backup before changes** (like OS patching). They are not replacements for full backups and can affect performance if left for long.

**Q4: What is Proxmox VE and how is it different from VMware?**

**A:**
* Open-source virtualization platform using **KVM (VMs)** and **LXC (containers)**.
* Web interface + CLI.
* Allows backup, snapshot, ISO upload, clustering (multiple nodes), storage types (local, NFS, Ceph).

**Q5: How do you create a VM in Proxmox?**

**A:**
1. Upload ISO (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
2. Click **Create VM**, choose name, OS, ISO
3. Set disk size, CPU, RAM
4. Configure network bridge (vmbr0)
5. Start and open console

**Q6: What is EC2 in AWS and how do you launch an instance?**

**A:**
* **EC2** is a virtual server in AWS cloud.
* Steps:
  1. Select AMI (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)
  2. Choose instance type (t2.micro etc.)
  3. Configure network and storage
  4. Add SSH keypair (PEM file)
  5. Launch and connect using:
     ```bash
     ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```

**Q7: What is an AWS Security Group?**

**A:**
A security group is like a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.

Example rules:
* Allow TCP 22 from your IP (for SSH)
* Allow TCP 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS

**Q8: What is S3 and how do you use it?**

**A:**
* S3 (Simple Storage Service) is object storage used for backups, file hosting, logs, static websites.
* You can create buckets, set public/private permissions, and upload/download files via web or AWS CLI.

### Useful Commands & Tools

## üíæ Area 5: Backup, Recovery & NAS Storage

### 1. Backup Concepts

* **Backup** is a copy of data to restore after accidental deletion, corruption, or system failure.
* **Types of backups**:
  * **Full** ‚Äì complete copy of all selected files.
  * **Incremental** ‚Äì only changes since the last backup (faster, smaller).
  * **Differential** ‚Äì changes since the last **full** backup (larger, but faster to restore).

üß† **3-2-1 Rule**:
> Keep **3 copies** of your data, on **2 different media**, with **1 copy offsite**.

### 2. Backup Tools (Server Admin Should Know)

#### For Linux:
* `rsync`: Efficient backup/sync tool.
  ```bash
  rsync -avh /source /backup
  ```
* `tar`: Archive and compress backup.
  ```bash
  tar -czvf etc_backup.tar.gz /etc
  ```

#### For Windows:
* **Windows Server Backup** (GUI tool).
* **`wbadmin`**: Command-line tool.
  ```cmd
  wbadmin start backup -backupTarget:D: -include:C: -allCritical -quiet
  ```

#### Enterprise Tools (Theory is enough if you haven't used):
* **Veeam** ‚Äì Great for virtual machine backups (VMware/Hyper-V).
* **Veritas NetBackup** ‚Äì Powerful enterprise backup solution.

### 3. Restore Basics

* Use `tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz` in Linux.
* Use `wbadmin start recovery` in Windows (or via GUI).
* Always **test backups** by performing restore operations.

### 4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Basics

* A **DR plan** is your response after critical failure (hardware failure, ransomware, natural disaster).
* Key points:
  * Backup frequency
  * Offsite/cloud storage
  * Restore time objective (RTO) and restore point objective (RPO)
  * Regular testing of recovery steps

### 5. NAS (Network Attached Storage)

* A NAS is a storage device (like Synology or QNAP) connected to the LAN.
* Used for shared folders, backups, and media/file storage.

üß† Protocols:
* **SMB/CIFS** ‚Äì Used by Windows for file shares.
* **NFS** ‚Äì Used by Linux/Unix systems.
* **FTP** ‚Äì For file transfer over the network.

### 6. NAS Admin Basics

* Access web UI (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`) to configure.
* Setup:
  * Volumes and shared folders
  * Users and permissions
  * Enable SMB/NFS/FTP as needed
  * Optional: configure RAID in the NAS

üõ† Good practice:
* Schedule NAS to **auto-backup to cloud** (like Google Drive or AWS S3).
* Use NAS **snapshots** + remote sync for critical folders.

### 7. Snapshot vs Backup

| Feature  | Snapshot                      | Backup                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Location | Same storage                  | External/cloud/secondary disk |
| Speed    | Instant                       | Slower (copy entire data)     |
| Use case | Rollback quickly (short-term) | Disaster recovery (long-term) |
| Risk     | If main storage fails, gone   | Survives if external          |

## üîπ **Area 6: Security & Firewall (Linux + Windows)**

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Firewall Basics (Concept)**

A **firewall** controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. It's like a gatekeeper for your server.

Types:

* **Host-based** (local to OS): `iptables`, `ufw`, Windows Defender Firewall
* **Network-based**: Fortinet, Sophos, Cisco ASA (covered in job JD)

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Linux Firewall: UFW & iptables**

#### üîπ UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall ‚Äì for Ubuntu)

```bash
ufw status
ufw allow 22/tcp       # Allow SSH
ufw deny 23/tcp        # Block Telnet
ufw enable
ufw disable
```

#### üîπ iptables (More powerful, but complex)

```bash
iptables -L                       # List all rules
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j DROP
iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules
```

üß† Remember:

* Ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3306 (MySQL), 21 (FTP)

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Windows Firewall Essentials**

#### GUI:

* Go to `Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings`

#### CLI (PowerShell / CMD):

```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow SSH" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=22
```

üß† Block outbound traffic for suspicious apps or open ports only as needed.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. SSH Hardening (Linux)**

1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

   ```bash
   Port 2222                   # Change default SSH port
   PermitRootLogin no          # Block root login
   PasswordAuthentication no   # Use key-based login
   AllowUsers devuser sysadmin
   ```

2. Restart SSH:

   ```bash
   systemctl restart sshd
   ```

3. Use **fail2ban** to block brute force:

   ```bash
   apt install fail2ban
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Antivirus Tools**

* **Linux**: ClamAV

  ```bash
  clamscan -r /home
  ```

  ss -tuln       # Shows listening ports
  netstat -tuln  # Older alternative
  ```
* **Windows**:

  ```cmd
  netstat -an | find "LISTEN"
  ```

---

### üí° Good to Know

* **NAT and Port Forwarding**: Used in firewalls to route external traffic to internal machines.
* **IDS/IPS**: Tools like Snort can detect/prevent attacks.
* **Security Logs**:
