# System Administrator Interview Preparation Guide

A comprehensive preparation guide for System Administrator interviews with focus areas, key topics, sample questions & answers.

## 📋 Priority Areas to Master

These are directly relevant and **high-impact** areas where your knowledge must be confident and demonstrable:

### 1. Linux and Windows Server Administration
- Installation, configuration, and troubleshooting of servers
- Service management (e.g., Apache, Samba, systemd)
- Log management (`/var/log`, `eventvwr`)
- SSH, remote desktop, user and permission management

### 2. RAID and Storage
- RAID levels (RAID 0, 1, 5, 10): understand the purpose, pros/cons, and how to configure
- Basic LVM (which you've mentioned in resume) – ensure you can explain and show CLI examples
- Storage troubleshooting (disk failures, mount issues, etc.)

### 3. Virtualization
- **VMware**: Basic understanding of ESXi, vCenter, VM creation, snapshots
- **Proxmox**: Since you used it in freelance, know how to relate it to VMware concepts

### 4. Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, GPO
- Structure and purpose of AD
- DNS/DHCP roles in AD setup
- Creating and linking GPOs
- Troubleshooting domain join issues

### 5. Backup and Restore
- Basics of **Veritas or Veeam** (even theory if no direct experience)
- Describe how you'd set up regular backups and restore data

### 6. Troubleshooting and Preventive Maintenance
- How you check system health (disk usage, RAM, CPU)
- How you would handle a sudden outage or performance degradation
- Use of monitoring tools or basic scripting for health checks

## 📋 Secondary Areas (Know Basics)

You should be able to talk about these but deep expertise is not expected for 6-months experience:

### 1. NAS & Enterprise Storage
- QNAP/Synology basics – how they're used, protocols (SMB, NFS)
- What is SAN vs NAS – use case and architecture

### 2. Cloud Integration (AWS)
- You've done cloud projects – be ready to briefly explain EC2, S3, and how you deployed web apps or managed infra

### 3. Security
- Describe basic hardening steps: disabling unused ports, configuring firewall (`ufw`, `iptables`, Windows firewall)
- VPNs and access control – even at a basic level

### 4. Automation & Scripting
- Bash: cron jobs, file backup scripts
- PowerShell: simple scripts to manage users, services
- Explain a script you've written for automating a real task

## 📋 Extras That Add Value

These can be discussed to stand out:

- CI/CD and GitHub Actions (as mentioned in your resume)
- Your RHCE certification – highlight the training, not just the cert
- Any real support incidents you handled (even in freelance) – what the issue was, how you solved it

## ⚠️ Topics You Can Be Light On

It's okay to have limited hands-on but basic understanding is good:

- VMware vCenter advanced features
- Veritas/Veeam actual console usage (mention theory and workflow)
- SAN zoning or enterprise EMC/NetApp if not experienced

**Q1: How do you check system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)?**

**A:**
```bash
top          # Live CPU & memory usage
htop         # Enhanced version of top
free -h      # Memory usage in human-readable format
df -h        # Disk space usage
lsblk        # Show block devices and mount points
```

**Q2: What are the runlevels in Linux? Difference between runlevel 3 and 5?**

**A:**
Runlevels define what system services are running.

0 – Halt (Shutdown)

1 – Single-user mode

3 – Multi-user with networking (No GUI)

5 – Multi-user with GUI

6 – Reboot

* **Runlevel 3**: Multi-user, command line only
* **Runlevel 5**: Multi-user with GUI

On `systemd` distros:

```bash
systemctl get-default         # Shows default target
```

* Runlevel 3 → `multi-user.target`
* Runlevel 5 → `graphical.target`

**Q3: How do you check which services are running and control them?**

**A:**
```bash
systemctl status sshd          # Check status
systemctl start sshd           # Start service
systemctl stop sshd            # Stop service

systemctl enable sshd          # Enable at boot
```

**Q4: What's the difference between hard and soft links?**

**A:**
* **Hard Link**: Actual duplicate pointing to same inode. Even if original is deleted, the link works.
* **Soft Link (symlink)**: Just a shortcut. Breaks if original file is deleted.

```bash
ln file1 file1_hard
ln -s file1 file1_soft
```

**Q5: Explain chmod 755.**

**A:**
* `7` = read(4) + write(2) + execute(1) → Owner
* `5` = read(4) + execute(1) → Group
* `5` = read(4) + execute(1) → Others

```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

Owner: full access, others: read + execute

**Q6: What is LVM? How to create a logical volume?**

**A:**
LVM = Logical Volume Manager, allows flexible disk management.

mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv
mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt
```

**Q7: What is crontab? How do you schedule a backup?**

**A:**
Crontab runs scheduled jobs.

```bash
crontab -e
```

Example:
```bash
0 2 * * * tar -czf /backup/backup.tar.gz /etc
```
(Backs up `/etc` every day at 2 AM)

**Q8: How do you check logs for troubleshooting in Linux?**

**A:**
```bash
journalctl -xe               # systemd logs

      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
```

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

**Q10: What is SELinux/AppArmor?**

**A:**
Security modules for Linux:

### Sample Interview Questions with Suggested Answers

**Q1: What is RAID and why is it used?**

**A:**
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology to combine multiple disks into one logical unit to improve performance, increase storage capacity, or provide redundancy in case of disk failure.

**Q2: What is the difference between Hardware and Software RAID?**

**A:**
* **Hardware RAID**: Managed by RAID controller card or motherboard BIOS.
* **Software RAID**: Managed by the operating system using tools like `mdadm` in Linux.
* Hardware RAID has better performance and is OS-independent.

**Q3: Explain RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10.**

**A:**
* **RAID 0**: No redundancy, just performance. If one disk fails, data is lost.
* **RAID 1**: Mirror. Same data written to 2 disks. High reliability.
* **RAID 5**: Striping + Parity. Need at least 3 disks. Can tolerate 1 disk failure.
* **RAID 10**: Combination of RAID 1 and 0. Needs 4 disks. High performance + redundancy.

🧠 Tip: Draw a quick diagram if allowed in whiteboard rounds!

**Q4: Have you configured RAID manually? How?**

**A:**
If not done practically:

> I've studied and observed RAID setup during my RHCE/college project. For example, using `mdadm` in Linux:

```bash
mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
```

Then format and mount:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid
```

**Q5: What happens when one disk in RAID 5 fails?**

**A:**
* RAID 5 can continue to function with **1 disk failure** using parity data.
* However, performance decreases.
* If a second disk fails before rebuild, data is lost.

**Q6: How do you monitor disk health in Linux?**

**A:**
* `smartctl -a /dev/sdX` – SMART disk health
* `dmesg` – check kernel disk errors
* `cat /proc/mdstat` – if using software RAID
* `lsblk`, `df -h` – for mounted partitions
* Third-party tools: Zabbix, Nagios

### Commands to Remember

```bash
# View all disks and partitions
lsblk

# Disk space usage
df -h
du -sh /folder

# Create partition
fdisk /dev/sdb

# Check RAID status (software)
cat /proc/mdstat

# View SMART status
smartctl -a /dev/sda
```

| **GPO (Group Policy)**    | Automating settings and enforcing security |

### Sample Interview Questions & Good Answers

**Q1: What is Active Directory and what is it used for?**

**A:**
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft. It stores information about users, computers, and other resources in a domain and helps administrators manage access and security centrally.

* AD is used for **authentication (login)** and **authorization (permissions)**.
* AD stores data in a structured hierarchy (domain → OU → objects).

**Q2: What are the main components of Active Directory?**

**A:**
* **Domain**: Logical group of objects (users, computers).
* **OU (Organizational Unit)**: Subdivision of a domain used to organize objects.
* **Domain Controller (DC)**: Server that hosts AD services.
* **Forest & Tree**: Top-level logical structure that can contain multiple domains.

**Q3: What is DNS and why is it important for Active Directory?**

**A:**
* DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (e.g., `server01.domain.com`) to IP addresses.
* **AD requires DNS** to locate domain controllers and for login, replication, and services to work.

🧠 AD creates special DNS records (SRV) during domain setup.

**Q4: What is DHCP and how does it work?**

**A:**
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices.

* The server maintains a **DHCP scope** (IP pool).
* Clients send a **DHCP Discover**, server replies with **Offer → Request → Acknowledge** (DORA process).

**Q5: What is Group Policy and how is it used?**

**A:**
Group Policy is a feature that allows administrators to define settings and rules for users or computers.

* GPOs (Group Policy Objects) are applied to **OUs** to enforce:
  * Security settings (password policy, screen lock)
  * Software deployment
  * Network configurations (drive mapping, firewall)

🧠 Tools:
* `gpedit.msc` – Local Group Policy Editor
* `gpmc.msc` – Group Policy Management Console

**Q6: How do you create and apply a GPO?**

**A:**
1. Open **Group Policy Management Console** (`gpmc.msc`)
2. Right-click OU → "Create a GPO"
3. Edit the GPO to configure settings
4. It automatically applies to all objects in the OU

**Q7: How do you troubleshoot GPO issues?**

**A:**
* Run `gpresult /h gp.html` or `gpresult /R` to check applied policies
* Use `rsop.msc` to simulate Resultant Set of Policy
* Use Event Viewer under **System or GroupPolicy** logs

**Q8: What is the difference between OU and Group?**

**A:**
* **OU** is used to organize objects (like a folder) – GPOs apply here.
* **Group** is used to grant permissions to users (e.g., read-only access to a folder).

**Q9: What are the types of groups in Active Directory?**

**A:**
* **Security Group**: Used to assign permissions
* **Distribution Group**: Used for email (not for security)
* Scope:
  * **Global**: Members from same domain
  * **Domain Local**: Permissions in local domain
  * **Universal**: Members and permissions across domains

**A:**
* **EC2** is a virtual server in AWS cloud.
* Steps:
  1. Select AMI (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)
  2. Choose instance type (t2.micro etc.)
  3. Configure network and storage
  4. Add SSH keypair (PEM file)
  5. Launch and connect using:
     ```bash
     ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```

**Q7: What is an AWS Security Group?**

**A:**
A security group is like a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.

Example rules:
* Allow TCP 22 from your IP (for SSH)
* Allow TCP 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS

**Q8: What is S3 and how do you use it?**

**A:**
* S3 (Simple Storage Service) is object storage used for backups, file hosting, logs, static websites.
* You can create buckets, set public/private permissions, and upload/download files via web or AWS CLI.

### Useful Commands & Tools

## 💾 Area 5: Backup, Recovery & NAS Storage

### 1. Backup Concepts

* **Backup** is a copy of data to restore after accidental deletion, corruption, or system failure.
* **Types of backups**:
  * **Full** – complete copy of all selected files.
  * **Incremental** – only changes since the last backup (faster, smaller).
  * **Differential** – changes since the last **full** backup (larger, but faster to restore).

🧠 **3-2-1 Rule**:
> Keep **3 copies** of your data, on **2 different media**, with **1 copy offsite**.

### 2. Backup Tools (Server Admin Should Know)

#### For Linux:
* `rsync`: Efficient backup/sync tool.
  ```bash
  rsync -avh /source /backup
  ```
* `tar`: Archive and compress backup.
  ```bash
  tar -czvf etc_backup.tar.gz /etc
  ```

#### For Windows:
* **Windows Server Backup** (GUI tool).
* **`wbadmin`**: Command-line tool.
  ```cmd
  wbadmin start backup -backupTarget:D: -include:C: -allCritical -quiet
  ```

#### Enterprise Tools (Theory is enough if you haven't used):
* **Veeam** – Great for virtual machine backups (VMware/Hyper-V).
* **Veritas NetBackup** – Powerful enterprise backup solution.

### 3. Restore Basics

* Use `tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz` in Linux.
* Use `wbadmin start recovery` in Windows (or via GUI).
* Always **test backups** by performing restore operations.

### 4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Basics

* A **DR plan** is your response after critical failure (hardware failure, ransomware, natural disaster).
* Key points:
  * Backup frequency
  * Offsite/cloud storage
  * Restore time objective (RTO) and restore point objective (RPO)
  * Regular testing of recovery steps

### 5. NAS (Network Attached Storage)

* A NAS is a storage device (like Synology or QNAP) connected to the LAN.
* Used for shared folders, backups, and media/file storage.

🧠 Protocols:
* **SMB/CIFS** – Used by Windows for file shares.
* **NFS** – Used by Linux/Unix systems.
* **FTP** – For file transfer over the network.

### 6. NAS Admin Basics

* Access web UI (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`) to configure.
* Setup:
  * Volumes and shared folders
  * Users and permissions
  * Enable SMB/NFS/FTP as needed
  * Optional: configure RAID in the NAS

🛠 Good practice:
* Schedule NAS to **auto-backup to cloud** (like Google Drive or AWS S3).
* Use NAS **snapshots** + remote sync for critical folders.

### 7. Snapshot vs Backup

| Feature  | Snapshot                      | Backup                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Location | Same storage                  | External/cloud/secondary disk |
| Speed    | Instant                       | Slower (copy entire data)     |
| Use case | Rollback quickly (short-term) | Disaster recovery (long-term) |
| Risk     | If main storage fails, gone   | Survives if external          |

## 🔹 **Area 6: Security & Firewall (Linux + Windows)**

---

### ✅ **1. Firewall Basics (Concept)**

A **firewall** controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. It's like a gatekeeper for your server.

Types:

* **Host-based** (local to OS): `iptables`, `ufw`, Windows Defender Firewall
* **Network-based**: Fortinet, Sophos, Cisco ASA (covered in job JD)

---

### ✅ **2. Linux Firewall: UFW & iptables**

#### 🔹 UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall – for Ubuntu)

```bash
ufw status
ufw allow 22/tcp       # Allow SSH
ufw deny 23/tcp        # Block Telnet
ufw enable
ufw disable
```

#### 🔹 iptables (More powerful, but complex)

```bash
iptables -L                       # List all rules
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j DROP
iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules
```

🧠 Remember:

* Ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3306 (MySQL), 21 (FTP)

---

### ✅ **3. Windows Firewall Essentials**

#### GUI:

* Go to `Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings`

#### CLI (PowerShell / CMD):

```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow SSH" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=22
```

🧠 Block outbound traffic for suspicious apps or open ports only as needed.

---

### ✅ **4. SSH Hardening (Linux)**

1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

   ```bash
   Port 2222                   # Change default SSH port
   PermitRootLogin no          # Block root login
   PasswordAuthentication no   # Use key-based login
   AllowUsers devuser sysadmin
   ```

2. Restart SSH:

   ```bash
   systemctl restart sshd
   ```

3. Use **fail2ban** to block brute force:

   ```bash
   apt install fail2ban
   ```

---

### ✅ **5. Antivirus Tools**

* **Linux**: ClamAV

  ```bash
  clamscan -r /home
  ```
* **Windows**: Windows Defender or third-party (Bitdefender, Kaspersky)

---

### ✅ **6. System Hardening Tips**

| Platform | Tips                                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | Disable unused services, patch regularly, file permission hygiene |
| Windows  | Enable firewall, disable guest account, auto-updates, BitLocker   |
| Both     | Strong passwords, disable USB ports, keep logs monitored          |

---

### ✅ **7. Security Best Practices**

* Use **sudo**, never work as root/admin directly
* Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible
* Set up **logging and alerts** for login attempts and failures
* Keep OS and packages **updated**
* Audit users & remove unused accounts

---

### ✅ **8. Bonus: Check for Open Ports**

* **Linux**:

  ```bash
  ss -tuln       # Shows listening ports
  netstat -tuln  # Older alternative
  ```
* **Windows**:

  ```cmd
  netstat -an | find "LISTEN"
  ```

---

### 💡 Good to Know

* **NAT and Port Forwarding**: Used in firewalls to route external traffic to internal machines.
* **IDS/IPS**: Tools like Snort can detect/prevent attacks.
* **Security Logs**:

  * Linux: `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog`
  * Windows: Event Viewer → Security
