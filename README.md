### ðŸ”¸ Interview Questions & Answers

---

### **Q1. What is virtualization and why is it used?**

**A**:
Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server using a hypervisor. It improves **hardware utilization**, **isolation**, and **scalability**.

ðŸ§  Hypervisors:

* Type 1: Bare-metal (e.g., VMware ESXi, Proxmox)
* Type 2: Hosted (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)

---

### **Q2. What is VMware ESXi and how do you manage it?**

**A**:

* VMware ESXi is a Type-1 hypervisor installed directly on physical servers.
* Managed via:

  * **vSphere Client/Web** (GUI)
  * **vCenter** (for multiple ESXi hosts)
  * CLI tools (`esxcli`)

Common Tasks:

* Create VM
* Allocate CPU/RAM
* Configure storage/network
* Take snapshots before major changes

---

### **Q3. What are snapshots in VMware and when should you use them?**

**A**:
Snapshots are point-in-time states of a VM, used for **backup before changes** (like OS patching). They are not replacements for full backups and can affect performance if left for long.

---

### **Q4. What is Proxmox VE and how is it different from VMware?**

**A**:

* Open-source virtualization platform using **KVM (VMs)** and **LXC (containers)**.
* Web interface + CLI.
* Allows backup, snapshot, ISO upload, clustering (multiple nodes), storage types (local, NFS, Ceph).

---

### **Q5. How do you create a VM in Proxmox?**

1. Upload ISO (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
2. Click **Create VM**, choose name, OS, ISO
3. Set disk size, CPU, RAM
4. Configure network bridge (vmbr0)
5. Start and open console

---

### **Q6. What is EC2 in AWS and how do you launch an instance?**

**A**:

* **EC2** is a virtual server in AWS cloud.
* Steps:

  1. Select AMI (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)
  2. Choose instance type (t2.micro etc.)
  3. Configure network and storage
  4. Add SSH keypair (PEM file)
  5. Launch and connect using:

     ```bash
     ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```

---

### **Q7. What is an AWS Security Group?**

**A**:
A security group is like a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.

Example rules:

* Allow TCP 22 from your IP (for SSH)
* Allow TCP 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS

---

### **Q8. What is S3 and how do you use it?**

**A**:

* S3 (Simple Storage Service) is object storage used for backups, file hosting, logs, static websites.
* You can create buckets, set public/private permissions, and upload/download files via web or AWS CLI.

### ðŸ”§ Useful Commands & Tools

| Tool/Command        | Description            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `qm list` (Proxmox) | List VMs               |
| `pvecm status`      | Proxmox cluster status |
| `esxcli`            | VMware CLI             |
| `aws configure`     | Setup AWS CLI          |
| `aws s3 ls`         | List S3 buckets        |
| `ssh -i key.pem`    | Connect to EC2         |

---

### âœ… Summary of What to Review

* VMware snapshot, VM create, console access
* Proxmox dashboard: creating VM, container, backups
* AWS: Launch EC2, security group, connect using key
* Basic billing awareness: free tier, instance limits
